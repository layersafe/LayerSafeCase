# LayerSafe 3D Printed Case Assembly Guide

Welcome to the LayerSafe 3D Printed Case assembly guide! Follow the steps below to easily assemble your case. Each step includes an accompanying GIF for further assistance.

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Connect the Base and Base Hinges
Start by connecting the base to the base hinges. The connection pins may be a bit tight to fit together, which is intentional to prevent them from coming loose. If needed, you can use pliers to gently squeeze them into place.

### 2. Slide the Side Pieces onto Each Rail
Carefully slide the side pieces onto the rails. They should slide on easily, and with a little pressure at the end, they will snap securely into place.

### 3. Add the Rail Connector to Both Side Rails
Once the side pieces are attached, secure the rail connector by sliding it onto both side rails. Like the side pieces, it should slide on easily, with a bit of pressure at the end to snap into place.

### 4. Add a Second Layer (Optional)
If you require additional storage, repeat the previous steps to add a second layer (or more).

### 5. Slide the Trays into the Case and Attach the Lid
Slide the trays into their designated slots, and then slide the lid onto the top of the case to complete the assembly.

### 6. Repeat the Steps for the Other Side of the Case
Follow steps 1â€“5 to assemble the other side of the case. Once complete, you should be able to close the case, and the clips should snap securely into place.

Opening the case might require some force, as the clips are designed to be very secure. Pressing the pegs on either side of the clip will release it. Applying a bit of pressure might be necessary.

### Securing Larger Models with Thumb Screws
The latest iteration includes securing screws for larger models, located at the base of the case. There is a threaded part that pushes through the bottom of the case, and a thumb screw part that screws down from inside.

These screws have a tapered section that you can use to secure larger miniatures in place.

*TODO: Add animation of thumb screws*
